Created this Social Media Application with React and Typescript with a firebase hosting with google authentication system.

App is deployed on Firebase Hosting: 
crudapp619.web.app
crudapp619.firebaseapp.com


-Used Firebase to store users data
-Embedded it with google a=login so that users can seamlessly login with their google accounts


Functionalities Of App:
- Users can create posts and share it
-Other users wil be able to see their posts and like it 
- All the likes and user posts will be saved on firebase storage
-Login and Logout functionality for the user

Problems i encountered:
- Can't get users seperate profile picture for posts they've made so i binded it with a user icon 
(currently user cant see the images of the people who posted .)
- issue in updating like count.


Fork it | Clone it | Update it | Modify it |
Ping me if you find the solutions to my problems.

Note: I plan on fixing these issues in the near future.
